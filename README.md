# React-native-world
This is the place where I will put everything I'm learning in my journey to develop mobile applications using React-native (aka online notebook for fellow learners to get benefit from and make unforgettable codes together! :) ✨). 

Online React-native sandbox I'm using at the moment:

## What is React-Native? 
An open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. 
1. __view__ :
2. __Components__ : At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components.
